# Chalk Mountain Services Asset Management System

## Project Purpose

![](/images/chalk.png)

[Chalk Mountain Services of Texas, LLC.](https://www.cmstx.com/) approached the TCU Department of Computer Science with a problem the company was facing. In order to keep track of their 1,300 combined tractors and trailers, users interfaced with an older, non-mobile-friendly website on which anyone in the company could denote assets as in- or out-of-service.

Our solution, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/emsanders1/ChalkMountainAssetManagement), seeks to address those problems by implementing role-based access in addition to a mobile-friendly design that anyone can use.
